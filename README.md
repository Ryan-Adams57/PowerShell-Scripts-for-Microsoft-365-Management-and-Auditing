# PowerShell-Scripts-for-Microsoft-365-Management-and-Auditing

I've created 100 PowerShell scripts specifically designed for managing, reporting, and auditing Microsoft 365 environments.

These Windows PowerShell scripts are one-line commands.

These scripts include capabilities such as:

License Management: Bulk assignment and removal.

Security Auditing: Detecting external email forwarding and monitoring external sharing.

User Lifecycle: Identifying inactive accounts and tracking sign-in activity.

Content Oversight: Tracking SharePoint file deletions and auditing email removals.

Resource & Collaboration: Reporting on room mailbox usage, calendar permissions, and Teams meeting attendance.

Each script is optimized for automation via Task Scheduler or Azure Automation.

Please reach out with any suggestions or specific script requirements you would like to see added.
